# Combining-Forest-Cover-Type
CoverType Prediction - Multi-Class Classification.

The dataset is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml//datasets/Covertype 
This dataset is already well prepared, polished and structured. You can get a simple model with 90%+ accuracy on this dataset but it also suffers with class imbalance.

Solving the same, this is one of my approaches.

Approach - Combining CoverTypes
Part1 - Modeling done on the Original data.
Part2 - Modeling done after Transformations
Part3 - Modeling done after Feature Engineering.
Part4 - Modeling done after Transforming the Feature-Engineered data(Part3).
